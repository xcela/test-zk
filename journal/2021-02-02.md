Testing daily journal

Setting up Foam workspace for Exocortex

Tried and failed to install WSL2 for Ubuntu. Windows store wouldnt let me install, kept stalling; couldn't sign up for "Windows Insider" to install view powershell, the page didn't load. Technocrapitalism!

    Needed WSL2 to work on Zulip (Remilia Chat). Mail server needs to go live so I can actually let users register. Want to setup LDAP maybe also so I can dispense with emails. 

    Foam seems pretty good so far. But the tooltip commands are distracting, that show up while you're writing.

Foam uses Journal nomenclature for daily notes. Maybe this makes more sense.

We'll need to see if we operate a custom Foam install or rely on their defaults. Then what are Roam/Obsidians?
